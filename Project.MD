1.1 The Opportunity
Our idea emerged from a very common issue that occurs in learning environments: the lack of participation and follow-up with students' understanding. Research has shown that while teachers ask between 300 and 400 questions per day, students ask around one question per week, showing a great disparity in the perceived participation in class (Almeida, 2012). It is well known that there is a wide gap between what the professors believe their students understand and the students’ actual comprehension of the material, as it can be complicated to genuinely know if students are truly following or simply pretending to keep up. In fact, studies have documented that students frequently avoid asking questions in class due to internalized norms of independence and fears of negative judgement, with over 80% of students hesitating to ask for help because they either want to solve problems on their own or because they are worried about how others would perceive them (van der Meij, 1988). Moreover, due to the complexity of truly gauging the students' progress and whether they are genuinely processing the material the professor is trying to convey, educators often use metrics of student performance, such as homework or check-up tests. However, this sort of follow-up occurs after class, when an incorrect understanding can create further confusion and might result in a greater amount of time for the professor to genuinely understand what their students are struggling with. 
1.2 Our Solution
With all of this in mind, our solution aims to fix these issues by proposing a new way to communicate the students' thought processes to the educators in real time, while giving students the chance to ask as many questions as they wish to an AI system. This system will give additional information on a topic without disrupting the class. ClassMate AI is an AI application available during the lessons for students to ask any questions on the topics currently covered by the professor. This application will act as an expert in these topics and will only answer with the inputs provided by the educator beforehand. This is done to  ensure continuity with the specific curriculum given. Studies have found that low levels of student questioning and explaining correlate with lower academic achievement (Almeida, 2012), thus by providing a channel for unlimited questioning, ClassMate AI aims to reverse this pattern and improve learning outcomes. 

To provide user-friendliness, educators can upload the relevant textbooks and articles at the beginning of the year. AI will separate this into distinct chapters, so that the educator can choose the topic they will be covering in class and make this material available to the AI. Additionally, educators can also upload the PowerPoints, and other materials used so that this is also available for the AI to answer more specific student questions. Apart from the slides, educators are able to add any additional content whenever, it is just a matter of uploading it through the app/website so that the AI is granted access to it. 

The questions asked by the students are received by the educator, but are made anonymous so that students are more comfortable in asking as many questions as they want without feeling like they are perceived as “dumb” or “clueless”. By removing the social exposure of the asking of questions, ClassMate AI eliminates these psychological barriers that often limit students’ learning potential. Recent studies have found that university students value AI chatbot assistants due to their responsiveness, interactivity, and confidentiality, as they allow them to ask questions without having to be vulnerable about their knowledge to their professor, which is precisely what ClassMate AI offers (Chen et al., 2023).

During the class the professor will have a small dashboard showcasing the top “confusion hotspots” in real time, allowing them to trace back and re-explain confusing concepts, plan future lessons based on the current struggles, or create more exercises for their students based on the most complicated topics. It is up to the educators how they use these insightful pop-ups, and depending on the specific type of education it serves, it may be more ideal for them to address the confusion in real time or to plan towards future measures to clear the confusion that is identified. The ClassMate AI dashboard will specifically show the topics that students find confusing, showing a hierarchy based on the topics they are struggling with the most, while also showing other topics that some students might be struggling with. This hierarchy is based on how many questions are asked regarding each specific topic.

An important problem with AI-applications is the adoption and implementation of it. Educators are often hesitant to integrate new technologies into their established pedagogical practices. However, studies have shown that educators are generally positive about the potential for chatbots to increase student engagement as long as they are perceived as useful and easy to use (Chen et al., 2023). In order to foster comfort and trust into ClassMate AI, we will integrate intricate filters to ensure only questions relevant to the topic being discussed are addressed, and any vulgar, offensive, or disruptive words and questions made will not be allowed to be submitted into the AI system. Moreover, the strict curriculum-based answers will ensure that the AI provides credible answers that students and teachers can rely on. Regardless, if students have specific questions that the AI does not seem to be able to answer with full confidence, it will flag them to the educator so that they can address them directly. This creates a hybrid environment where the AI-system and the professional educator can provide valuable and reliable insights to the students.

Additionally, ClassMate AI will provide post-class insights for the professor, showing who has been active on the platform in each class, as well as an overview of the specific questions asked in that class. With the knowledge of who has been active, educators can observe their students’ engagement and how this differs/progresses over time. If used concurrently, the AI will highlight which students have been inactive for long periods of time, showing who may “need attention”. With this feature, educators can provide further support if needed; combining their own perception of the student’s understanding and their digital engagement, the professor can decide what may be more convenient for the student. Moreover, as the professor can now see the exact questions being asked, they can also gain deeper insight into their students' reasoning patterns, allowing them to make changes to their teaching styles to better fit students’ needs and also prepare future classes based on current uncertainties they have.

Given that these issues are so predominant and salient in the context of learning, and that technological advances and the incorporation of AI in our daily lives is becoming inevitable; we want ClassMate AI to be a salient technology that allows a smooth transition towards change that allows educators to maintain control and bring the main knowledge into the classroom, while taking advantage of the huge value points these new technological discoveries can bring to the table. Ideally, we will make important steps towards improving student engagement during classes and greatly improve the understanding educators have of the tacit knowledge acquisition process that students go through. Essentially, we want to enhance the use of technology as a value-adding activity rather than a replacement in the workplace. In doing so, ClassMate AI provides value to both stakeholders, creating a virtuous cycle where improved student understanding leads to more effective teaching, which in turn fosters deeper engagement and learning outcomes.
